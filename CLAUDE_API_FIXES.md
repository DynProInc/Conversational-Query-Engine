# Claude API Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

The Conversational Query Engine was experiencing two main issues:

1. **Claude API Error**: The system was trying to use `gpt-4` as a model name with the Anthropic Claude API, causing a 404 error
2. **OpenAI Quota Error**: The system was falling back to OpenAI when Claude failed, but the OpenAI quota was exceeded

## Root Causes

### 1. Invalid Model Configuration
- **File**: `config/clients/env/mts.env`
- **Issue**: Invalid model name `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` and malformed line with space before equals sign
- **Fix**: Corrected to use valid model `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`

### 2. Incorrect Default Provider
- **File**: `config/client_integration.py`
- **Issue**: System defaulted to OpenAI instead of Anthropic when no specific provider was requested
- **Fix**: Changed default provider from OpenAI to Anthropic (Claude)

### 3. Model Retrieval Logic
- **File**: `api_server.py`
- **Issue**: Unified endpoint was using `os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_MODEL")` instead of client-specific configuration
- **Fix**: Updated to retrieve model from client configuration when client_id is provided

### 4. Error Hint Fallback
- **File**: `error_hint_utils.py`
- **Issue**: Error hint generation defaulted to OpenAI when no specific model was identified
- **Fix**: Changed default to Claude (Anthropic) with OpenAI as fallback

## Files Modified

### 1. `config/clients/env/mts.env`
```diff
- CLIENT_MTS_ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
- CLIENT_MTS_ANTHROPIC_MODEL = claude-3-haiku-20240307
+ CLIENT_MTS_ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
```

### 2. `config/client_integration.py`
```diff
- # Default to OpenAI if provider not recognized
- providers_to_load = ['openai']
- # If no provider specified, try to load OpenAI as default
- providers_to_load = ['openai']
+ # Default to Anthropic if provider not recognized (since this is a Claude-focused system)
+ providers_to_load = ['anthropic']
+ # If no provider specified, default to Anthropic (Claude) instead of OpenAI
+ providers_to_load = ['anthropic']
```

### 3. `api_server.py`
```diff
- # Use default model name
- request.model = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_MODEL", "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")
+ # Get the model from client configuration
+ if client_id:
+     from config.client_manager import client_manager
+     claude_config = client_manager.get_llm_config(client_id, 'anthropic')
+     request.model = claude_config.get('model', "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")
+ else:
+     request.model = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_MODEL", "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")
```

### 4. `error_hint_utils.py`
```diff
- # If no specific model is identified, use default OpenAI
- if not provider:
-     if openai is not None:
-         provider = 'openai'
-         model = os.environ.get('OPENAI_MODEL', 'gpt-4o')
+ # If no specific model is identified, use default Claude (since this is a Claude-focused system)
+ if not provider:
+     if anthropic is not None:
+         provider = 'claude'
+         model = os.environ.get('ANTHROPIC_MODEL', 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022')
+     elif openai is not None:
+         provider = 'openai'
+         model = os.environ.get('OPENAI_MODEL', 'gpt-4o')
```

## Testing Results

After applying the fixes, the system now:
- ✅ Correctly loads client-specific Anthropic configuration
- ✅ Uses valid Claude model names
- ✅ Sets environment variables properly through client context
- ✅ Successfully connects to Claude API
- ✅ No longer falls back to OpenAI unnecessarily

## Verification

The fixes were verified using a test script that confirmed:
1. Client configuration loads correctly
2. Environment variables are set properly with client context
3. Claude API responds successfully with the correct model

## Impact

These fixes resolve:
- The 404 error when using Claude API
- The OpenAI quota exceeded error
- Incorrect model name issues
- Environment variable configuration problems

The system now properly defaults to Claude (Anthropic) as the primary LLM provider, which aligns with the intended architecture of this Conversational Query Engine.
