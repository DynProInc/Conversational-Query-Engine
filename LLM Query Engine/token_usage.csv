Therefore, we will use this table only without any joins.  ### STEP 3: FINAL SQL QUERY  ```sql SELECT     t1.ITEM_NUMBER,     t1.CITY,     SUM(CAST(t1.DAILY_SALES AS NUMERIC)) AS TOTAL_SALES,     SUM(CAST(t1.GROSS_PROFIT AS NUMERIC)) AS TOTAL_GROSS_PROFIT FROM     V_SMM_ITEM_DAILY_SALE t1 WHERE     t1.TRANSACTION_QUARTER = '3'     AND t1.TRANSACTION_YEAR = '2024'     AND t1.STORE_NUMBER = '11'     AND t1.ACCOUNT_TYPE_NAME = 'RETAIL' GROUP BY     t1.ITEM_NUMBER,     t1.CITY ORDER BY     TOTAL_SALES DESC LIMIT 4; ```  ### Explanation: - We are selecting the `ITEM_NUMBER`, `CITY`, and aggregating `DAILY_SALES` and `GROSS_PROFIT` for the specified conditions. - The query filters for transactions in the third quarter of 2024, for store number 11, and where the account type is 'RETAIL'. - The results are grouped by `ITEM_NUMBER` and `CITY` to get the total sales and gross profit for each item. - The results are ordered by `TOTAL_SALES` in descending order to get the top 4 items. - The `LIMIT 4` clause ensures that only the top 4 items are returned.",3105,664,3769,0.03105,0.01992,0.05097,0

Let's assume you have a table named `sales` with columns `product_id`, `product_name`, and `sales_amount`. The SQL query to find the top 3 products by sales would look like this:  ```sql SELECT product_name, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales FROM sales GROUP BY product_name ORDER BY total_sales DESC LIMIT 3; ```  This query does the following: - Selects the `product_name` and the sum of `sales_amount` for each product. - Groups the results by `product_name` to aggregate sales for each product. - Orders the results in descending order based on the total sales amount. - Limits the results to the top 3 products.
